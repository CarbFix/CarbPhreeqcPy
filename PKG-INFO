         `CarbPhreeqcPy <https://github.com/CarbFix/CarbPhreeqcPy>`_ provides an updated version of the abandoned `IPhreeqcPy`_ (see below), updating the version of PHREEQC as well as adding the `carbfix.dat thermodynamic database <https://github.com/CarbFix/carbfix.dat>`_ to the package.

         `IPhreeqcPy`_  provides a wrapper to communicate with `IPhreeqc`_ in `python`_. 
         It is an alternative to `PhreeqPy`_ and is derived from `PhreeqPy`_. 
         One of the drawback of `PhreeqPy`_ was that it used pythonic names spaces for
         `IPhreeqc`_  function calls which made `PhreeqPy`_ function calls different
         from `IPhreeqc`_. Secondly it did not have automated compilation for `Iphreeqc`_  
         during installation. As `PhreeqPy`_ is an open source I took further
         liberty to address this issue and redistribute it as `IPhreeqcPy`_ to avoid 
         conflicts with development of `PhreeqPy`_. Moreover more Iphreeqc function 
         calls are included in `IPhreeqcPy`_ e.g. function calls related to dump which
         can be of use while restarting simulations.
