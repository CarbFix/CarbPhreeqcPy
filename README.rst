`CarbPhreeqcPy <https://github.com/CarbFix/CarbPhreeqcPy>`_ provides an updated version of the abandoned `IPhreeqcPy`_ package (see below), including more recent `PHREEQC/IPhreeqc <http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/>`_ versions as well as adding the `carbfix.dat thermodynamic database <https://github.com/CarbFix/carbfix.dat>`_ to the package.

The `IPhreeqcPy`_  provided a wrapper to communicate with `IPhreeqc`_ in `Python`_.
Ravi A. Patel created it as an alternative to `PhreeqPy`_ and is derived from `PhreeqPy`_.
